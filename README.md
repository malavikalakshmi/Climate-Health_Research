In this documentation, we are focusing on three questions: 
  1. "Mortality from total cardiovascular diseases"
  2. "Premature mortality among adults aged 45-64 years"
  3Â· "Mortality with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as underlying or contributing cause among adults aged >= 45 years"

We divided into two branches, gender and races, and used three models to explore the relationship between dependent variable (disease) and independent variables (climate variables). 

We splitted data into training and testing, and used the accuracy to measure the performance of our models. The results shown as follow: 

1. Mortality from total cardiovascular diseases
  Races: 
    1. Linear Regression: 77.08%
    2. Random Forest: 96.30%
    3. Gradient Boosting Tree: 89.10%
  
  Gender:
    1. Linear Regression: 28.62%
    2. Random Forest: 91.34%
    3. Gradient Boosting Tree: 85.70%
    
 2. Premature mortality among adults aged 45-64 years
    Races: 
      1. Linear Regression: 62.08%
      2. Random Forest: 90.52%
      3. Gradient Boosting Tree: 80%

    Gender:
      1. Linear Regression: 72.01%
      2. Random Forest: 95.36%
      3. Gradient Boosting Tree: 92.60%
      
 3. Mortality with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as underlying or contributing cause among adults aged >= 45 years
     Races: 
      1. Linear Regression: 72.58%
      2. Random Forest: 93.45%
      3. Gradient Boosting Tree: 80.30%

    Gender:
      1. Linear Regression: 32.00%
      2. Random Forest: 90.85%
      3. Gradient Boosting Tree: 89.40%
